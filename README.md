# Pandas Homework Trends

Below are the observable trends I spotted while looking at the data:

1. Male players make the largest player pool by a very wide margin (84.03% to a combined 15.97% between Female and other)

2. Due to more players, Male players tend to pay less per purchase ($4.07 compared to $4.47 for female players, and $4.56 for other players)

3. Players ages 20-24 are the largest percentage of players and account for 46.8% of the total sales.
